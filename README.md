# Predicting-Insurance-Charges
I am predicting insurance charges for customers based on various attributes. Insurance charges primarily depend on numerous factors, making it challenging to segregate large volumes of data and extract insightful information. To address this, I am building a machine learning model aimed at achieving good accuracy in predicting customer charges.

I have implemented the AdaBoost Regressor, achieving a training accuracy of over 78%. As I enhance the data, I anticipate further improvements in accuracy.
